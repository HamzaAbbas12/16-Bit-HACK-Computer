# 16-Bit-HACK-Computer
This repository details my journey in building a 16-bit Hack Computer as part of the "NAND to Tetris" course. I began with basic logic gates and advanced to complex components like the ALU, sequential logic circuits, and machine language. The project culminated in a fully functional 16 bit computer.
